# Self-directed learning

**Duration: 1.5 hours**

When you work as a software developer, it is _crucial_ to be able to research, read documentation, and implement your findings.

We have only scratched the surface of what Vue is capable of. Your task, by yourself or with a partner, is to research and implement one of these things:

Using `vue init webpack my_app_name`

- Unit Testing in Vue
- Vue Router

Using `vue init webpack-simple my_app_name`

- Computed Properties

Using `vue create my_app_name` then `vue add vuetify`:

- Vuetify

We are purposely not providing links to the documentation. Be a resilient developer; use Google, YouTube, tutorials, and a little bit of moxie to do what you need to do.

Demonstrate your chosen feature in a very small app.

If you feel comfortable that you understand your chosen topic, and you have time, move on to another one.

You will be asked to present your learning to the class afterwards. Be prepared for a five minute presentation answering the following questions:

- When would I use this feature? What problem does it solve?
- How can I implement it?
